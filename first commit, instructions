hi i already created a repository
it has nothing on it.

these are the first tasks

- create a react app
- for design, the theme for the app will be just the color red and white, no need for aesthetics just pure simple red and white
- make a login page (no need for a register page as passwords will be provided to the user), for future reference (no need to do it now) we will have different user access,
      most probably superadmin, admin, encoder, staff

P.S
You are expected to work 40 hours a week. Time is flexi. You can choose your days off.

Please make sure to send a short report of your progress every after shift for tracking. kindly include the features accomplished, known bugs if any, questions and clarifications if any
and things to do for next shift.

work on dev branch
